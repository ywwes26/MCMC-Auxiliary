# MCMC-Auxiliary
Collection of codes to replicate the simulation results in the paper: [Markov Chain Monte Carlo without evaluating the target: an auxiliary variable approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05242)

## Heterogeneous truncated Gaussian
Folder `hetero-trunc-gaussian` contains the source codes to replicate the simulation results in Section 5.1. Executing the file `TruncGaussian.jl` will output a file containing the samples, time per step and number of accept for all MCMC algorithms.
